# More Accessible Horiseon Website

## Description and Purpose: 
I refactored the starter code, so the Horiseon website has more accessibility. 

## Notable Features Improving the Accessibility of The New Horiseon Website
* Every image has alternative text in case the image doesn't load properly. 
* Sequential Heading organization 
* Elements follow semantic HTML and CSS structure.
